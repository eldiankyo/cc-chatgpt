## Introduction

ChatGPT program to the ComputerCraft mod (Minecraft).
In CC there are Lua files, and uses the HTTP API to communicate with programs which are outside of Minecraft.
Therefore I wrote a local "server" (server.py) in Python which handles the HTTP requests and returns the response from ChatGPT into the game.

## Prerequisites

OpenAI API key
Python
Python modules: flask, dotenv, openai
